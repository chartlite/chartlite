# Chartlite Roadmap

**Version**: 0.1.0
**Last Updated**: October 29, 2025

## Vision

Build a lightweight (~20KB core), high-performance charting library for **developers building modern web apps**. We're "Recharts but 10x lighter and 5x faster" - professional charts with zero dependencies, beautiful defaults, and TypeScript-first DX.

**Perfect for**: Landing pages with live metrics, blog posts with visualizations, documentation sites, simple internal dashboards.

**Not for**: Real-time monitoring dashboards, complex data exploration tools, applications with millions of data points.

## Feature Priority Reference

Based on our refined philosophy for developers building modern web apps:

### CORE (Always included or high priority)

- ‚úÖ Multi-Series Support (Phase 1)
- ‚úÖ Reference Lines (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Annotations (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Accessibility (Phase 3)
- ‚úÖ Design System Themes (Phase 5)

### NICE-TO-HAVE (Tree-shakeable optional features)

- ‚≠ê Tooltips (Phase 4)
- ‚≠ê Export Utilities (Phase 4)
- ‚≠ê Real-time Updates (Phase 4)

### NOT IN SCOPE

- ‚ùå Click Events (no interactivity beyond accessibility)
- ‚ùå Interactive Legend (legend is static only)
- ‚ùå Zoom/Pan (dashboard feature)
- ‚ùå Brush Selection (dashboard feature)
- ‚ùå DataZoom (dashboard feature)
- ‚ùå Complex Filtering (dashboard feature)
- ‚ùå 3D Charts (out of scope)
- ‚ùå Real-time monitoring for millions of points (use ECharts)

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Critical Dependencies

- **None** (zero runtime dependencies is a core principle)

### Development Dependencies

- TypeScript 5.5+
- Vitest 4.0+
- tsup 8.0+
- Turborepo 2.0+
- jsdom (for testing)

### Potential Blockers

- **Bundle size creep**: Mitigated by strict tree-shaking and size budgets per phase
- **Framework wrapper maintenance**: Delayed to Phase 6 after core is stable
- **Feature scope creep**: Strict "CORE vs NICE vs NOT IN SCOPE" guidelines
- **Accessibility testing**: Need proper testing tools and expertise

## Decision Log

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **SVG over Canvas**: Better for static/semi-static charts, easier styling, print-friendly, accessible
2. **Zero runtime dependencies**: Smaller bundle, no supply chain risk, better security
3. **Framework-agnostic core**: Enables any framework wrapper without core changes
4. **TypeScript-first**: Full type safety, autocomplete, better DX
5. **Monorepo structure**: Code sharing, consistent tooling, single source of truth
6. **Tree-shakeable optional features**: Advanced features in core but only included if imported
7. **Flexible data formats**: Support 4 data formats (DataPoint[], number[], Column-Oriented, Series-First)
8. **Responsive by default**: ResizeObserver for automatic chart resizing

### Philosophy Evolution

**Original**: "Content not dashboards" (implied end-user focus)

**Refined**: Tools for **developers** building modern web apps:

- Landing pages with live metrics
- Blog posts with visualizations
- Documentation sites with charts
- Simple internal dashboards

**Target Audience**: Developers, not executives or end-users. We optimize for DX, not end-user interactivity.

**Positioning**: "Recharts but 10x lighter and 5x faster"

### Deferred/Rejected Decisions

- ‚ùå **Separate plugin packages** (@chartlite/tooltips, etc.): Rejected - developers hate installing multiple packages. Use tree-shaking instead.
- ‚ùå **Interactive features** (click events, brush, zoom): Rejected - dashboard features, not our focus
- ‚ùå **3D charts**: Out of scope entirely
- ‚ùå **Canvas rendering**: Deferred - SVG works well for our target use cases
- ‚ùå **Millions of data points**: Out of scope - recommend ECharts for this
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Web component wrappers**: Deferred - evaluate demand after framework wrappers
